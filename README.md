# TUFApp

An unofficial Windows app for browsing and downloading ADOFAI custom levels and packs from [The Universal Forums](https://tuforums.com).

- Search levels, packs, passes, leaderboard and creators
- One-click download into your ADOFAI custom level folder
- Manage downloaded levels and check for updates

## Build

Requires the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/desktop) and Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop development with C++).

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build windows --release
```

## Translations

UI text lives in `lib/l10n/app_<language code>.arb`, with English (`app_en.arb`) as the template. To add a language, copy `app_en.arb` to e.g. `app_ja.arb`, set `@@locale`, translate the values and rebuild; it then appears in the language menu. Messages left untranslated fall back to English.
